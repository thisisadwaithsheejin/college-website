      <h3>ADWAITH SHEEJIN</h3>
      <p>I've been there nearly 3 years(2018-2021).Our course was taught very well to us , they always offered a good explanation and recap where we needed it. I always felt comfortable to ask question and speak about the subject.  It’s been such an amazing experience to study in a good environment with supportive tutors. I would recommend anyone to join Jaya College of Arts and Science  because the staffs are so supportive and help throughout anything. They always make you work to the best of your ability and  encourage you to do your best in every aspect.There’s wide range of facilities that can be accessed to help with education such as library facilities. I really enjoyed being there. Overall I would highly recommend you to join here for a good experience!</p>
